## Introduction
- Our products provide a solid and comprehensive foundation of expertise in the field of electronics and programming
- We are proud to fully meet the design requirements for the "motor and sensor control circuit for greenhouses"
- The product includes three main parts: power part, sensor part, motor part
- Each layer is calculated in detail, taking on separate functions, contributing to creating a complete and effective product.
## How the System Works
### System Overview:
- My goal is to learn more about BJT, MOSFET, IGBT circuits, as well as temperature and light sensors.
- This will not only help me improve my logical thinking ability but also expand my knowledge about power efficiency, power, bandwidth gain and signal amplitude.
- This knowledge will be a solid foundation for me to develop, research and design hardware in the future, thereby improving my professional level.
